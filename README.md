# Valentine's Day Interactive Website (CodeKage)

Thank you to [@mewtru](https://instagram.com/mewtru) for the video idea!

This code was completely created from scratch! utilising Tailwind CSS!

Make this Valentine's Day unforgettable with a charming and interactive web experience. This website allows you to ask the big question, "Will you be my Valentine?" in a unique and playful manner. With cute GIFs that change with responses and dynamic "Yes" and "No" buttons, it's designed to bring a smile and possibly a "Yes!" to someone special.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Engage with "Yes" and "No" buttons that dynamically respond to user input.
- **Cute GIFs**: Enjoy a selection of heartwarming GIFs that change based on the user's interaction.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Stylish design and responsive layout powered by Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript Magic**: Experience the joy of interaction with JavaScript that brings the website to life.

## How It Works

- The user is greeted with a cute GIF and the question "Will you be my Valentine?".
- Responding "No" changes the GIF and modifies the size and text of the buttons, adding a playful element to convince the user to reconsider.
- A "Yes" click celebrates the moment with a special GIF and triggers a confetti animation, hiding the response buttons.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
